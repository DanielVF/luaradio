# Installation

Currently, LuaRadio can be installed from the Arch Linux AUR or from source.

Packaging for other distributions and platforms is a work in progress.

## Installing from Arch Linux AUR

LuaRadio is available in the Arch Linux AUR under the package
[`luaradio`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/luaradio).

## Installing from Source

**1. Install LuaJIT**

Most Linux distributions have LuaJIT in their official package repositories.

**2. Install LuaRadio**

```
git clone git://github.com/vsergeev/luaradio.git
cd luaradio/embed
make
sudo make install
```

**3. Install liquid-dsp and/or libvolk for real-time acceleration**

LuaRadio has no hard dependencies outside of LuaJIT, but for real-time
applications, the [liquid-dsp](https://github.com/jgaeddert/liquid-dsp) or
[libvolk](http://libvolk.org), and [fftw](http://www.fftw.org/) libraries are
strongly encouraged for appreciable performance.

These libraries may be available in your distribution's package repositories.
Otherwise, the instructions for installation from source are reproduced below.

Build and install [liquid-dsp](https://github.com/jgaeddert/liquid-dsp):

```
git clone git://github.com/jgaeddert/liquid-dsp.git
cd liquid-dsp
./bootstrap.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

Build and install [libvolk](https://github.com/gnuradio/volk) (optional,
depends on boost):

```
git clone git://github.com/gnuradio/volk.git
cd volk
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make test
sudo make install
```

**4. Check Install**

The `liquid`, `volk`, and `fftw3f` features should be marked true in LuaRadio's
platform information, if the respective libraries were found by LuaRadio.

```
