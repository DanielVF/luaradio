# Installation

LuaRadio can be installed from the Arch Linux AUR or from source.

Packaging for other distributions and platforms is a work in progress.

## Installing from Arch Linux AUR

LuaRadio is available in the Arch Linux AUR under the package
[`luaradio`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/luaradio).

## Installing from Source

Install LuaJIT. Most platforms have LuaJIT in their official package
repositories.

Build and install LuaRadio:

```
git clone https://github.com/vsergeev/luaradio.git
cd luaradio/embed
make
sudo make install
```

LuaRadio has no hard dependencies outside of LuaJIT, but for real-time
applications, the [liquid-dsp](https://github.com/jgaeddert/liquid-dsp) or
[VOLK](http://libvolk.org), and [fftw](http://www.fftw.org/) libraries are
strongly encouraged for appreciable performance. These libraries may be
available in your distribution's package repositories, or can be built from
source.

Check the installation by dumping the platform information:

```
$ luaradio --platform
luajit          LuaJIT 2.0.4
os              Linux
arch            x64
page size       4096
cpu count       4
cpu model       Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4570T CPU @ 2.90GHz
features
    fftw3f      true
    volk        true
    liquid      true
$
```

The `liquid`, `volk`, and `fftw3f` features should be marked true, if the
respective libraries were found by LuaRadio.
